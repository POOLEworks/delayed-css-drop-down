CSS drop down menus are nice. They don't require JavaScript and usually insist semantic markup.

But the problem with CSS only menus is that they close as soon as your mouse leaves. This annoying, especially for multi-level drop down.


CSS transitions to the rescue

Using CSS transitions we can simulate a JavaScript timer to close the menu after a short delay.
